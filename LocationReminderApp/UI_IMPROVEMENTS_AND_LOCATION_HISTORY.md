## Technical Implementation

### Storage Structure
```javascript
// Location History
{
  id: "timestamp",
  latitude: number,
  longitude: number,
  address: string,
  timestamp: ISO string,
  radius: number (optional)
}

// Location Frequency
{
  "lat_lng_key": {
    location: { latitude, longitude, address },
    count: number,
    lastUsed: ISO string
  }
}
```

### Integration Points
1. **StorageService Integration**:
   - Automatically saves location when creating reminder
   - Initializes LocationHistoryService on app start

2. **Context Integration**:
   - Location history available throughout the app
   - Shared between all reminder creation flows

## Usage Guidelines

### For Users
1. **Creating Reminders**:
   - Use quick location picker for frequent destinations
   - Search for new locations
   - History automatically saves used locations

2. **Managing History**:
   - Edit mode in location selection to remove items
   - Clear all option for privacy
   - Frequency tracking helps identify important locations

### For Developers
1. **Adding New Location Sources**:
   ```javascript
   await LocationHistoryService.addLocation({
     latitude: lat,
     longitude: lng,
     address: "Location Name",
     radius: 100 // optional
   });
   ```

2. **Retrieving Location Suggestions**:
   ```javascript
   const suggestions = await LocationHistoryService.getLocationSuggestions();
   ```

## Future Enhancements
1. **Location Categories**: Tag locations (Home, Work, Shopping, etc.)
2. **Location Sharing**: Share favorite locations between devices
3. **Smart Suggestions**: ML-based location predictions
4. **Location Groups**: Create groups of related locations
5. **Export/Import**: Backup and restore location history

## Performance Considerations
- Location history limited to 15 items to prevent storage bloat
- Frequency data cleaned up for unused locations
- Efficient deduplication based on coordinates
- Async operations for smooth UI performance
